title: 2.0 release
---
<p>There is a spiffy new 2.0 release out in the world now, and you can download it <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=5235&#038;release_id=32770">here</a> and release notes are <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/shownotes.php?group_id=5235&#038;release_id=32770">here</a>. This is our first release since refactoring for the plugin architecture, so we thought it deserved a major number bump. Also, we&#8217;ve re-arranged the subversion tree so current development is now happening in trunk. Docs on the wiki are updated accordingly. The rdocs from the Blacklight plugin are visible online now too, <a href="http://blacklight.rubyforge.org/">here</a>. Please have a look and give us some feedback! </p>
