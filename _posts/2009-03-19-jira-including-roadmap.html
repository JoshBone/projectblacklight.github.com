title: JIRA ... Including Roadmap
---
	<p>There&#8217;s a JIRA instance up (<a href="http://blacklightopac.org:8080/jira/browse">http://blacklightopac.org:8080/jira/browse</a>) that can be used for bug reports, feature requests, etc.  We currently have things categorized into &#8220;release 2.0&#8243; and &#8220;release 2.1&#8243; &#8230; but that is likely to evolve as the project grows.</p>
	<p>We have also decided to have the Roadmap in a single place:  in JIRA.</p>
	<p><a href="http://blacklightopac.org:8080/jira/browse/CODEBASE?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Aroadmap-panel">http://blacklightopac.org:8080/jira/browse/CODEBASE?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Aroadmap-panel</a></p>
