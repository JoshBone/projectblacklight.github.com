title: Blacklight 3.1 released!
---

<p>Release 3.1.0 of Project Blacklight is now available via <a href=https://rubygems.org/gems/blacklight>Ruby Gems</a>. Instructions for installing Blacklight or upgrading an existing installation can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki">wiki</a>. 

Here are just a few things that are new in Blacklight 3.0:
<ul>
    <li> Fixes for various deprecation warnings and other features for Rails 3.1 compatibility (note that Rails 3.1 asset pipeline/scss work will be in a future release, this is purely compatibility work)</li>
    <li> Patches from the Hydra Project cleaning up our code  (thanks Justin!) </li>
    <li> Fix for CODEBASE-350: kaminari performance terrible with large number of pages. If you've made local modifications to your pagination template, be sure to read through the ticket.</li>
    <li> Removed integrated unAPI support. The mechanism unAPI was changed into a (loosely) controlled vocabulary in HTML5 and the unAPI maintainers were uninterested in the HTML5 "link relation" process. unAPI support is still available through the blacklight_unapi plugin (https://github.com/cbeer/blacklight_unapi) if you wish to continue using unAPI.</li>
</ul>
