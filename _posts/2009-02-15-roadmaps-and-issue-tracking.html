title: Roadmaps and Issue Tracking
---
<p>We now have a publicly accessible issue tracking system available at http://blacklightopac.org:8080/jira. Anyone who would like to report issues, request new features, help us track down bugs or get involved with development, please make yourself an account and jump right in. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the start of a roadmap for release 2.0 available <a href="http://blacklightopac.org:8080/browse/CODEBASE?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Aroadmap-panel">here</a>. Watch that space for additions as we start to firm up what features we want to commit to for 2.0. Suggestions from the community?  </p>
