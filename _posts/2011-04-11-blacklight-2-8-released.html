<p>Also, the GitHub compare view of this release vs. our last release is located at<a href="http://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/compare/v2.7.0...v2.8.0">http://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/compare/v2.7.0...v2.8.0</a></p>

<p>NOTE WELL:  After upgrading from a former version, you will need to add these two lines to config/blacklight_config.rb (or any other initializer) in order to maintain email/SMS functionality:</p>

<pre>

    # Email uses the semantic fields mappings below to generate the body
    # of an email.
    SolrDocument.use_extension( Blacklight::Solr::Document::Email )

    # SMS uses the semantic fiels mappings below to generate the body of
    # an SMS email.
    SolrDocument.use_extension( Blacklight::Solr::Document::Sms )
    </pre>
