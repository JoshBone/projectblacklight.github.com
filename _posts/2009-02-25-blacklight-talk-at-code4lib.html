title: Blacklight talk at code4lib
---
<p>I just finished a talk on Blacklight at code4lib and it went really well. Apparently people really like our notion of distributing BL as an overloadable plugin, because there was some spontaneous applause when I mentioned it. You can view the slides here: <a href="http://code4lib.org/files/blacklight_code4lib09.pdf">http://code4lib.org/files/blacklight_code4lib09.pdf</a>. There&#8217;s going to be a breakout session this afternoon, and I&#8217;ll post about that, too. &#8211;Bess</p>
