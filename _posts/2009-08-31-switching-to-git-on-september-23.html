title: switching to git on September 23
---
<p>Dear Blacklight Community,</p>
<p>The committers on the project have been discussing for some time now a move to git from subversion for source code management. The time has come to make that switch. Moving to git will allow us to more easily branch and merge changes, which will make it easier to have a greater number of people working on the code base at once without stepping on each other&#8217;s toes. It will also make it easier for folks who aren&#8217;t official committers to the project to make code contributions, and for us to accept them and merge them into the core code base.</p>
<p>The new source code repository will be available at <a title="projectblacklight at github" href="http://github.com/projectblacklight">http://github.com/projectblacklight</a></p>
<p>We will make the switch on Wednesday the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">9th</span> 23rd of September. Before that time we hope to have re-written the documentation for checking out source code, re-configured our hudson continuous build system to use git instead of svn, and re-written our capistrano deploy scripts that come with the demo app, but some of this may lag behind the actual switch. Please bear with us as we make the change, and help us out by reporting any places where we&#8217;ve missed documentation updates.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t used git yet, consider setting up a git account now and playing around with it. You can get a free account at github.com, and if you follow projectblacklight you can choose to be notified of any changes that occur to that project. If you&#8217;re currently on our subversion commit changes list, github services will be replacing that list, and I&#8217;ll send out a separate email about how to make sure you continue receiving notifications of code commits. If you need an introduction to using git, I highly recommend Pro Git by Scott Chacon, which is available both in print and online at <a title="git book" href="http://progit.org/">http://progit.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for being such a fantastic community!</p>
