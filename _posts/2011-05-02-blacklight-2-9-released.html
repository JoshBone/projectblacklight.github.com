title: Blacklight 2.9 released!
---

<p>This is a relatively minor release, however it will be the last release that supports Rails 2. Shortly after this release, the "master" branch of Blacklight will be Rails 3 only.  Future releases will distributed as Rails 3-compatible gems. Details on this migration, and documentation to assist implementors during the migration process will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>For Blacklight 2.9.0, the major feature is the solr_search_params refactor (<a href="http://jira.projectblacklight.org/jira/browse/CODEBASE-307">CODEBASE-307</a> and documented on <a href="https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Extending-or-Modifying-Blacklight-Search-Behavior">the wiki</a>). For implementations that heavily customized the search experience, be sure to read the documentation around this new feature and update your applications accordingly. </p>

<p>There are also a handful of bug fixes, mainly in the test suite.</p>

<p>The JIRA issues are at <a href="http://jira.projectblacklight.org/jira/browse/CODEBASE/fixforversion/10071">Blacklight 2.9 release</a></p>
