---

<p>Release 3.2.0 of Project Blacklight is now available via <a href=https://rubygems.org/gems/blacklight>Ruby Gems</a>.  We've posted an upgrade guide to the Blacklight wiki <a href="https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Blacklight-3.2-Release-Notes-and-Upgrade-Guide">Blacklight 3.2 Release Notes and Upgrade Guide</a>, with information about upgrading to use the asset pipeline, new per-controller configuration, and more.

Here are the major new features in Blacklight 3.2:

<ul>
  <li> This release requires Rails 3.1 and the Rails asset pipeline. </li>
  <li> CSS uses the asset pipeline (as SCSS) and support modular overriding of styles</li>
  <li> Catalog configuration was refactored from a global configuration to a per-controller, DSL-based configuration</li>
  <li> Facets rendering refactor, which makes it easier to override the display of facet fields</li>
  <li> Updated blacklight-jetty to use Solr 3.5 (and update the version of SolrMarc distributed in Blacklight to 2.3.1)</li>
</ul>
