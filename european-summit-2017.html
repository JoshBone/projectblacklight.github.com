          <p>
            A draft schedule is available at:
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DqaQ6P1Bm_DxtbbLbZOi0inpO7-kgL19nxcXannPB2A">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DqaQ6P1Bm_DxtbbLbZOi0inpO7-kgL19nxcXannPB2A</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            All participants are invited to give a lightning talk. A lightning talk is a five to seven minute presentation on a compelling topic related to cultural heritage imaging, your work, or that of your organization. Slides and demos are encouraged, but a free-form talk is also great.  The goal is to introduce yourself, stimulate thought and generate ideas for meeting sessions.
