				<h3>Option 1: Read the Friendly Manual</h3>
<p>Your first effort should always be to read the <a href="http://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight">documentation</a>, check the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a>, and search the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/blacklight-development">mailing list archives</a>. </p>
<h3>Option 2: Post to the mailing list</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re still stuck, please feel free to post to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/blacklight-development">the mailing list</a>. </p>
<p> In order to reduce spam, the first time you post your email will be held in a moderation queue, but as soon as your first message is approved your posts won&#8217;t be held for moderation any longer. </p>
<h3>Option 3: IRC</h3>
<p>Please feel free to join the conversation on our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc">IRC</a> channel. You can usually find several of the project committers hanging out there during North American office hours. We use chat.freenode.net and we are channel #blacklight</p>
