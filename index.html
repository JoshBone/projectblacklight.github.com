		<h2>What is Blacklight?</h2>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>Blacklight is a free and open source Ruby on Rails based discovery interface (a.k.a. &#8220;next-generation catalog&#8221;) especially optimized for heterogeneous collections. You can use it as a library catalog, as a front end for a digital repository, or as a single-search interface to aggregate digital content that would otherwise be siloed.</p>
<h2>What are some of the features?</h2>
<p>Blacklight uses <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a>, an enterprise-scale index for its search engine. Blacklight features faceted browsing, relevance based searching (with the ability to locally control the relevancy algorithms), bookmarkable items, permanent URLs for every item, user tagging of items.</p>
<h2>Who uses it?</h2>
<p>The University of Virginia Library and Stanford University Library are the primary development partners, but you can see a current list of installations on our <a href="/examples.html">Examples</a> page.</p>
<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
